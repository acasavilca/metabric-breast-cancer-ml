            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent and life-threatening forms of cancer among women worldwide. Despite advancements in early detection and treatment, predicting patient outcomes and tailoring personalized therapies remains difficult due to the biological complexity of the disease. One of the key challenges in breast cancer management is the high degree of heterogeneity at both the clinical and molecular levels, which complicates prognosis and treatment decisions. However, gene expression profiling has emerged as a powerful tool to uncover the biological underpinnings of breast cancer heterogeneity and to predict clinical outcomes. The landmark study by Van ’t Veer et al. [1] demonstrated that gene expression signatures could be used to predict breast cancer prognosis, laying the groundwork for molecular subtyping and personalized therapy. Building on this, large-scale analyses, such as Curtis et al. [2], revealed novel breast cancer subgroups based on combined genomic and transcriptomic data, underscoring the complexity of the disease. Further research has highlighted the relationship between gene coexpression networks and clinical outcomes. For instance, Clarke et al. [3] performed large-scale coexpression analyses and found that specific transcriptional networks were significantly correlated with breast cancer survival. Such findings emphasize the value of moving beyond single-gene analyses toward understanding complex gene-gene interactions.</p>
            <p>Building on this body of work, this project leverages the <strong>METABRIC dataset</strong> [4], introduced by Curtis et al. [2], to build machine learning models for patient classification and outcome prediction. The dataset includes gene expression profiles and clinical data for nearly 2,000 breast cancer patients. The dataset provides detailed information on over 600 genes as well as clinical variables such as patient age, tumor size, hormone receptor status, and survival outcomes.</p>
